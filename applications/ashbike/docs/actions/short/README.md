# Times Square Dense Zigzag Loop

### **Route Totals**

* **Total Distance:** ~2.32 km (approx. 1.44 miles)
* **Total Time:** 3 minutes and 43 seconds

---

### **Detailed Breakdown**

The route consists of 12 track points forming a tight, high-turn loop. Because this is a simulation with speed variations, the pace changes significantly throughout the segments:

| Metric | Start | End |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Timestamp** | 21:00:00Z | 21:03:43Z |
| **Elevation** | 16.0 m | 16.0 m |
| **Coordinates** | 40.7593, -73.9848 | 40.7593, -73.9848 |

### **Observations**

* **The Loop:** The route is a true loop, ending at the exact same coordinates and elevation where it began.
* **Speed Profile:** The average speed is roughly **37.5 km/h**, fitting the 20–50 km/h variation mentioned in the metadata.
* **Navigation:** Given the density of these turns in such a short window (12 points in under 4 minutes), this is definitely an intensive test for GPS smoothing or navigation logic.


Segment-by-Segment Analysis
The route consists of 11 individual segments between the 12 track points.

Summary Totals
Total Distance: 2,304.21 meters (approx. 2.30 km or 1.43 miles)

Total Time: 223 seconds (3 minutes and 43 seconds)

Average Speed: 37.21 km/h

The data shows significant fluctuations in speed, ranging from a slow crawl of 21.83 km/h (Segment 5) to a peak of 55.49 km/h (Segments 6 and 10), which matches the "advanced GPS simulation" description in the GPX metadata.
